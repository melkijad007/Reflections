Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When sharing your code with other people. And to have a backup somewhere else. 

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

A: That way you have more control over the version of your project on local machine.
